# NeuroLauncher: Physics EEG Launcher Project
The Playwright code is located in `tests/example.spec.js`.
The Arduino code is titled `NeuroLauncher.ino`. The Playwright code assumes this file to be located in a directory titled `~/NeuroLauncher`.

Dependencies: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), an automation library commonly used in browser testing/web scraping. I use it in accessing the data from the [Neurosity](https://console.neurosity.co/) website.
